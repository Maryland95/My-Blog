<p> Sign of the Times - lyrics</p>
<div class="song">Just stop your crying
    It's a sign of the times
    Welcome to the final show
    Hope you're wearing your best clothes
    You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
    You look pretty good down here
    But you ain't really good
    If we never learn, we been here before
    Why are we always stuck and running from
    The bullets?
    The bullets
    We never learn, we been here before
    Why are we always stuck and running from
    The bullets?
    The bullets
    Just stop your crying
    It's a sign of the times
    We gotta get away from here
    We gotta get away from here
    Just stop your crying
    It'll be alright
    They told me that the end is near
    We gotta get away from here
    Just stop your crying
    Have the time of your life
    Breaking through the atmosphere
    And things are pretty good from here
    Remember everything will be alright
    We can meet again somewhere
    Somewhere far away from here
    We never learn, we been here before
    Why are we always stuck and running from
    The bullets?
    The bullets
    We never learn, we been here before
    Why are we always stuck and running from
    The bullets?
    The bullets
    Just stop your crying
    It's a sign of the times
    We gotta get away from here
    We gotta get away from here
    Stop your crying
    Baby, it'll be alright
    They told me that the end is near
    We gotta get away from here
    We never learn, we been here before
    Why are we always stuck and running from
    The bullets?
    The bullets
    We never learn, we been here before
    Why are we always stuck and running from
    The bullets?
    The bullets
    We don't talk enough
    We should open up
    Before it's all too much
    Will we ever learn?
    We've been here before
    It's just what we know
    Stop your crying, baby
    It's a sign of the times
    We gotta get away
    We got to get away
    We got to get away
    We got to get away
    We got to get away
    We got to, we got to, away
    We got to, we got to, away
    We got to, we got to, away
